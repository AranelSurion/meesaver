The Debian Package meesaver
----------------------------

MeeSaver simply picks a random wallpaper from a given location and sets it as a wallpaper.

Thanks to:
 * merlin1991 on Freenode for his unbreakable patience, and for sharing his QML/Python knowledge with me :)
 * itsnotabigtruck and jonni for teaching me how Aegis works, from scratch :)
